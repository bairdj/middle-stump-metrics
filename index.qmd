title: Middle Stump Metrics
---

The purpose of this site is to provide interesting or unusual statistics about cricket. It is inspired
by some of the obscure records and statistics that are often mentioned during Test Match Special.

This site uses data sourced from [Cricsheet](http://cricsheet.org/), and is focused on Test matches.
Cricsheet includes Test matches from approximately 2002 onwards, and is updated regularly.

```{r}
#| label: build-time
#| output: asis
#| echo: false

# Print the time that the site was built,
# and the most recent match in the database.
library(lubridate)
current_time <- now(tzone = "UTC")

cat("Updated at:", format(current_time, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M %Z"), "\n\n")

library(dplyr)
source(here::here("R", "model.R"))
db <- Model$new()
most_recent_match <- db$table("Match") |>
  slice_max(StartDate, n = 1, with_ties = FALSE) |>
  select(StartDate, Team1, Team2, Venue) |>
  collect()

most_recent_str <- glue::glue(
  "Most recent match: ",
  "{most_recent_match$Team1} vs {most_recent_match$Team2} at {most_recent_match$Venue} on {most_recent_match$StartDate}."
)

cat(most_recent_str)
```
